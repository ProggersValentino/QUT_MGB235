## What is Inventory?

- Stock of items kept to meet future demand – based on forecasts – applies to both goods and services.
- Independent-demand items
  - Items that are ready to be sold or used
- Is spare capacity another form of inventory?
- Inventories are a vital part of business: (1) necessary for operations and (2) contribute to customer satisfaction
  - A “typical” firm has roughly 30% of its current assets and as much as 90% of its working capital invested in inventory

## Role of Inventory in the Value Chain

The role of inventory in the value chain, emphasizing how inventory must be managed efficiently to ensure high-quality customer service. It shows the interconnectedness of different inventory types and their impact on overall operations.

## Quality Management in the Supply Chain

- As one key aspect of quality management customers usually perceive quality service as availability of goods they want when they want them
- Inventory must be sufficient to provide high-quality customer service in QM
- But this raises the question of how does one decide on the trade off between cost and quality?

## The Different Types of Inventory

### Types of Inventory

- _Raw Materials, component parts, subassemblies, and purchased parts supplies (MRO):_ inputs to manufacturing and service-delivery processes.
- _Work-in-process (WIP) inventory:_ partially finished products in various stages of completion that are awaiting further processing.
- _Finished goods inventory (FG):_ completed products ready for distribution or sale to customers.
- _Items being transported_

## The Different Types of Inventory

### Basic Inventory Concepts

- **_Pipeline inventory:_** inventory that has been ordered but not yet received and is in transit.
- **_Anticipation inventory:_** built up during the off-season to meet future estimated demand.

## The Different Types of Inventory

### Basic Inventory Concepts

- **_Cycle inventory (order or lot size inventory):_** inventory that results from purchasing or producing in larger lots than are needed for immediate consumption or sale.
- **_Safety stock inventory:_** an additional amount of inventory that is kept over and above the average amount required to meet demand.

## Inventory Management

- **_Inventory_** is any asset held for future use or sale.
- The expenses associated with financing and maintaining inventories are a substantial part of the cost of doing business (cost of goods sold).
- **_Inventory Management_** involves planning, coordinating, and controlling the acquisition, storage, handling, movement, distribution, and possible sale of raw materials, component parts and subassemblies, supplies and tools, replacement parts, and other assets that are needed to meet customer wants and needs.

## Objectives of Inventory Control

- Inventory management has two main concerns:
    1. Level of customer service
        - Having the right goods available in the right quantity in the right place at the right time
    2. Costs of ordering and carrying inventories
        - The overall objective of inventory management is to achieve satisfactory levels of customer service while keeping inventory costs within reasonable bounds
            1. Measures of performance
            2. Customer satisfaction
                - Number and quantity of backorders
                - Customer complaints
            3. Inventory turnover

## Inventory Control (Management) Systems

- Purpose of inventory management
  - how many units to order
  - when to order
- Continuous system (fixed-order-quantity)
  - constant amount ordered when inventory declines to predetermined level
- Periodic system (fixed-time-period)
  - order placed for variable amount after fixed passage of time

## Inventory Management Systems

### Characteristics of Inventory Systems

- **Number of items:** each item is identified by its stock-keeping unit (SKU) or barcode
- A **stock-keeping unit (SKU)** is a single item or asset stored at a particular location.
- Maintaining **data integrity** on thousands of SKUs is difficult but must be done.
- Applies predominantly to goods – services pose different issues

### Nature of demand

- - **Independent demand**: demand is unrelated to the demand for other SKUs and must be forecast.
    - **Dependent demand**: demand directly related to the demand of other SKUs and can be calculated without needing to be forecast.
    - **Deterministic demand** is when uncertainty is not included in its characteristics.
    - **Stochastic demand:** incorporates uncertainty by using probability distributions (for information only).
    - **Static demand**: stable demand.
    - **Dynamic demand**: varies over time (for information only).

### Characteristics of Inventory Systems

- **Number of time periods in planning horizon:** short or long planning horizon such as days, weeks, months, quarters, and years.
- **Size of time periods:** hours, days, weeks, months, quarters.
- **Lead time:** time between placement of an order and its receipt.
- **Stockouts:** inability to satisfy demand for an item. When a stockout happens the item is either back-ordered or a sale is lost.
- **Backorder** occurs when a customer is willing to wait for an item.
- **Lost sale** occurs when the customer is unwilling to wait and purchases the item elsewhere.
- **Perishability:** SKU deteriorates or becomes obsolete after a certain period of time. **Examples ?**

## Data Accuracy

### Inventory Management Infrastructure

**_Cycle Counting:_** system for repetitive physical counting of inventory throughout the year.

**_Purpose of cycle counting_** is to check on the accuracy of actual physical inventory and improve data integrity.

- **_Telematic diagnostic and monitoring systems:_** two-way wireless communication capabilities between equipment and its external environment.
- **_Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags_** (chips) embedded in packaging, products or shipping containers to constantly update the status of the SKU.

## Prioritizing the importance of inventory items

### Inventory managers deal with two fundamental decisions

1. **_When to order_** items from a supplier or when to initiate production runs, if the firm makes its own items, and
2. **_How much to order_** or produce each time a supplier or production order is placed.

### Inventory Management Decisions & Costs

Four categories of inventory costs:

- - 1. Ordering or setup costs
        2.  Inventory-holding costs
        3.  Shortage costs
        4.  Unit cost of the stock-keeping units (SKUs)

### Inventory Management Infrastructure

- **ABC inventory (Pareto) analysis** gives managers useful information to identify the best methods to control each category of inventory
- A vital few SKUs represent a high percentage of the total dollar inventory value.

### ABC Inventory (Pareto) Analysis

- “**A**” items account for a large **dollar** value but relatively small percentage of total items. 10% of items yet 80% of total dollar usage.
- “**C**” items account for a small dollar value but a large percentage of total items; can be managed using automated computer systems. 50% to 60% of items yet about 5% to 10% total dollar value.
- “**B**” items are between A and C (30% of items but only 15% of total dollar usage).

## ABC Classification System

### A-B-C approach

Classifying inventory according to some measure of importance, and allocating control efforts accordingly

**A items** (very important)

- 10 to 20 percent of the number of items in inventory and about 60 to 70 percent of the annual dollar value

**B items** (moderately important)

**C items** (least important)

- 50 to 60 percent of the number of items in inventory but only about 10 to 15 percent of the annual dollar value

## Fixed Order Quantity System

- **_Fixed Quantity Systems (FQS):_** the order quantity or lot size is fixed; the same amount, Q, is ordered every time.
- The process of triggering an order is based on the inventory position.
- **_Inventory Position (IP):_** on-hand quantity (OH) plus any order placed but have not arrived (scheduled receipts, or SR), minus any backorders (BO).

**_IP = OH + SR – BO_**

### Fixed Quantity System - when to order

- **_When inventory falls at or below a certain value a new order is placed; This is called the reorder point, r_**
- **_Reorder point depends on the lead time and nature of demand—oftentimes, the reorder point is selected using the average demand during the lead time r = d xL_**
- **_Where d is average demand per unit of time and L_**

**_is the lead time expressed in the same unit of time._**

_The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model is a classic economic model developed in the early 1900s that minimize total cost, which is defined as the sum of the inventory-holding cost and the ordering cost:_

_Annual Ordering Cost = Number of Orders Per Year \* Cost Per year = (D/Q)_ _C<sub>o</sub>_

_D annual demand_

**_C<sub>o</sub>_** _internal cost assessment e.g. from order placement to order receipt_

_Q_ _number of units in the fixed order \*_

_The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model is a classic economic model developed in the early 1900s that minimize total cost, which is defined as the sum of the ordering cost and the inventory-holding cost:_

_Annual Inventory Holding Cost = Average Inventory \* Annual Holding Cost Per Unit = 0.5\*Q\*_ _C<sub>o</sub>_

_Cost of storing one unit in inventory (SKU) for the year (Cc), is given by Cc = I x C, where I is annual inventory-holding charge as a percentage of the unit cost of the inventory item C, and;_

_Q/2 is the average number of units of an SKU in inventory_

## Fixed Order Quantity System Total Cost (TC) of Inventory Summary

_C<sub>o</sub>_ - cost of placing order _D_ - annual demand

_C<sub>c</sub>_ - annual per-unit carrying cost _Q_ - order quantity

But we don’t know the economic order quantity (_Q_)?

### You need to be able to apply the EOQ Model

**Q\*** is the quantity that minimizes the total cost and is known as the _economic order quantity._

## Example: EOQ & simplified reorder point

A wholesaler of consumer electronics operates 52 weeks per year. The following information is for one of the Video Cassette Recorders that they stock and sell.

- Demand = 4500 units/year
- Ordering costs (C<sub>o</sub>) = $40/order
- Holding costs (C<sub>c</sub>) = $3/unit/year
- Number of weeks per year = 52 weeks
- Lead time = 2 weeks

### Question and Solution

1\. Using the fixed order quantity system to control inventory, compute the EOQ and state your ordering decision rules.

\= 346.4 units

2\. Compute the reorder point and state the order decision rule

Order decision rule: Place a new order for 346 units when the inventory position drops to or past the reorder point of 1741 units.

1. Compute the total annual cost: inventory holding cost plus the ordering cost:

TC = (346/2)\*3 + (4,500/346)\*40 = $519 + $519 = $1,038

## Key Assumptions of the EOQ Model

- Only a single item (SKU) is considered.
- The entire order quantity (_Q_) arrives in the inventory at one time. No physical limits are placed on the size of the order quantity, such as shipment capacity or storage availability.
- Only two types costs are relevant—order/setup and inventory holding costs.
- No stockouts are allowed.
- The demand for the item is deterministic and continuous over time. This means that units are withdrawn from inventory at a constant rate proportional to time. For example, an annual demand of 365 units implies a monthly demand of 365/12 and a daily demand of one unit.
- Lead time is constant.

## Fixed Period Systems

- An alternative to a fixed order quantity system is a
- **_fixed period system (FPS)_**—sometimes called a
- periodic review system—in which the inventory
- position is checked only at fixed intervals of time, T,
- rather than on a continuous basis.

## Single-Period Inventory Model

- Applies to inventory situations in which one order is placed for a good in anticipation of a future selling season where demand is uncertain.
- At the end of the period, the product has either sold out or there is a surplus of unsold items to sell for a salvage value.
- Sometimes it is called a _news-vendor problem_, because newspaper sales are a typical example of the single-period inventory problem.
