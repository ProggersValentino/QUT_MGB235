## Aggregate Planning: Summary
- Aggregate planning establishes general levels of employment, output, and 
inventories for periods of 2 to 12 months. In the spectrum of planning, 
it falls between the broad decisions of long-range planning and the very 
specific and detailed short-range planning decisions. 
It begins with an overall forecast for the planning horizon and ends with 
preparations for applying the plans to specific products and services.

- The essence of aggregate planning is the aggregation of products or services 
into one “product” or “service.” This permits planners to consider overall 
levels of employment and inventories without having to become involved with 
specific details that are better left to short-range planning. 
Planners often use informal graphic and charting techniques to develop plans, 
although various mathematical techniques have been suggested.

- After the aggregate plan has been developed, it is disaggregated or broken 
down into specific product requirements. This leads to a master schedule, 
which indicates the planned quantities and timing of specific outputs. 
Inputs to the master schedule are on-hand inventory amounts, forecasts of demand, 
and customer orders.

## Meeting Demand Strategies

**Adjusting capacity**:

Resources to meet demand are acquired and maintained over the time horizon of the plan

Minor variations in demand are handled with overtime or under-time

**Managing demand**:

Proactive demand management

## Discussion Questions
1. Discuss several alternatives for adjusting capacity. Discuss several alternatives for managing demand.
   Adjusting Capacity:

**Level Production:** Producing at a constant rate and using inventory to absorb fluctuations in demand.

**Chase Demand:** Hiring and firing workers to match demand.

**Peak Demand:** Maintaining resources (staffing) for high levels of customer service.

**Overtime and Undertime:** Increasing or decreasing working hours.

**Subcontracting:** Letting outside companies complete the work (outsourcing).

**Part-time Workers:** Hiring part-time workers to complete the work.

**Backordering:** Providing the service or product at a later time period.

**Managing Demand:**

**Proactive Demand Management:** Partnering with suppliers to reduce information distortion along the supply chain.

**Counter-cyclical Demand Patterns:** Offering products or services with counter-cyclical demand patterns.

**Shifting Demand:** Using incentives, sales promotions, and advertising campaigns to shift demand into other time periods.

2. Service operations often face more difficulty in planning than their manufacturing counterparts. However, service does have certain advantages that manufacturing often does not. Explain service planning difficulty, and its advantages and disadvantages.

**Service Planning Difficulty:**

**Non-inventoriable:** Most services cannot be inventoried.

**Demand Uncertainty:** Demand for services is difficult to predict.

**Capacity Uncertainty:** Service capacity is difficult to predict and must be provided at the appropriate place and time.

**Labor Constraints:** Labor is usually the most constraining resource for services.

**Advantages of Service Operations:**

**Flexibility:** Services can often be customized to meet customer needs more easily than manufactured goods.

**Customer Interaction:** Direct interaction with customers can provide immediate feedback and the ability to quickly address issues.

**Disadvantages of Service Operations:**

**Intangibility:** Services are intangible, making it harder to measure and control quality.

**Variability:** High variability in service delivery can lead to inconsistent customer experiences.

**Perishability:** Services are perishable and cannot be stored for future use.

3. What is ERP? What are the three main reasons firms adopt ERP?
   ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning):
   A comprehensive, integrated system used to manage and coordinate all the resources, information, and functions of a business from shared data stores.

Three Main Reasons Firms Adopt ERP:

**Integration:** To integrate financial information, customer order information, and other key business processes.

**Efficiency:** To improve efficiency by automating and streamlining business processes.

**Data Accuracy:** To enhance data accuracy and provide better access to information for decision-making.

4. How does ERP fit with e-commerce and supply chain management?
   ERP and E-commerce:

**Integration:** ERP systems integrate with e-commerce platforms to streamline online transactions, inventory management, and order processing.

**Real-time Data:** Provides real-time data on inventory levels, customer orders, and shipments, enhancing the e-commerce experience.

**ERP and Supply Chain Management:**

**Visibility:** Enhances visibility across the supply chain, allowing for better coordination and collaboration with suppliers and partners.

**Efficiency:** Improves supply chain efficiency by automating processes such as procurement, production planning, and logistics.

**Demand Planning:** Facilitates accurate demand planning and forecasting, helping to balance supply and demand.

5. To what extent has technology such as ERP software improved the ability to manage a business organization? How important are each of the following considerations?
   Improvement through ERP Software:
   ERP software has significantly improved the ability to manage business organizations by providing integrated, real-time data, streamlining processes, and enhancing decision-making capabilities.

**Considerations:**

**Ease of Use:** Highly important as it ensures user adoption and reduces the learning curve, making the system more effective and efficient.

**Complete Integration:** Crucial for providing a unified view of the organization's data and processes, enabling better coordination and decision-making.

**Reliability:** Essential for ensuring that the system is dependable and that data is accurate, which is critical for maintaining trust and operational continuity.
