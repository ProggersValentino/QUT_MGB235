## Lean production – defined

An integrated management system that emphasizes the elimination of waste and the continuous improvement of operations (Russell and Taylor, 2014, p.723)

- - A flexible system that uses minimal resources and produced high quality goods and services (Stevenson, 2021, p.612)

Just in time (JIT) – smoothing the flow of material to arrive just as it is needed (Russell and Taylor, 2014, p.723).

## Lean System Principles

Five principles embody the way lean systems function:

- 1. Identify customer values
  2. Focus on processes that create value
  3. Eliminate waste to create “flow”
  4. Produce only according to customer demand
  5. Strive for perfection

## Benefits & Risks of Lean Systems

- Key benefits
  - Reduced waste
  - Lower costs
  - Increased quality
  - Reduced cycle time
  - Increased flexibility
  - Increased productivity
- Critical risks
  - Increased stress on workers
  - Fewer resources available if problems occur
  - Supply chain disruptions can halt operations

## Lean Operations: The Beginning

- Lean operations began as lean manufacturing, also known as JIT, in the mid-1900s
- Developed by Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Ohno of Toyota
  - Focus was on eliminating all waste from every aspect of the process
    - Waste is viewed as anything that interferes with, or does not add value to, the process of producing automobiles
  - Many terms used by Toyota, such as Kanban, Kaizen, and Muda, are commonly used industry wide.

## Basic Elements of 

[**Lean Production**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfsRAZUnonI)

- Doing more with less inventory, fewer workers, less space
- Just-in-time (JIT)
  - smoothing the _flow_ of material to arrive just as it is needed
  - “JIT” and “Lean Production” are used interchangeably
- Muda
  - waste, anything other than that which adds value to product or service

## Waste in Operations

Overproduction – Producing items we cannot immediately use or sell

Waiting: For parts, machines and downstream operations

Transporting: Moving items needlessly

Processing: Unnecessary steps that do not add value

Inventory: Storing, retrieving, counting, insuring, taking up space and money

Movement: Searching for tools, parts, instruction, approval, etc

Defects: Rework and scrap

Talent: Underutilization of worker knowledge and skills

## Basic Elements

1. Flexible resources
2. Cellular layouts
3. Pull system
4. Kanbans
5. Small lots
6. Quick setups
7. Uniform production levels
8. Quality at the source
9. Total productive maintenance
10. Supplier networks

## Flexible Resources

- Multifunctional workers
  - perform more than one job
  - general-purpose machines perform several basic functions
- Cycle time
  - time required for the worker to complete one pass through the operations assigned
- Takt time
  - paces production to match the rate customer demand

## Cellular Layouts

- Manufacturing cells
  - comprised of dissimilar machines brought together to manufacture a family of parts
- Cycle time is adjusted to match takt time by changing worker paths

## Pull System

- Material is pulled through the system when needed
- Reversal of traditional push system where material is pushed according to a schedule
- Forces cooperation
- Prevent over and underproduction
- While push systems rely on a predetermined schedule, pull systems rely on customer requests

## Kanbans

- Card which indicates standard quantity of production
- Derived from two-bin inventory system
- Maintain discipline of pull production
- Authorize production and movement of goods

### Types of Kanban

### Production kanban

- - authorizes production of goods

### Withdrawal kanban

- - authorizes movement of goods

### Kanban square

- - a marked area designated to hold items

### Signal kanban

- - a triangular kanban used to signal production at the previous workstation

### Material kanban

- - used to order material in advance of a process

### Supplier kanban

- - rotates between the factory and suppliers

## Small Lots

- Require less space and capital investment
- Move processes closer together
- Make quality problems easier to detect
- Make processes more dependent on each other

## Quick Setups

### Internal setup

- - Can be performed only when a process is stopped

### External setup

- - Can be performed in advance

### SMED\* Principles

- - Separate internal setup from external setup
    - Convert internal setup to external setup
    - Streamline all aspects of setup
    - Perform setup activities in parallel or eliminate them entirely

## Techniques for Reducing Setup Time

Preset Desired Settings

Use Quick Fasteners

User Locator Pins

Prevent Misalignment

Eliminate Tools

Make Movements Easier

## Uniform Production Levels

- Result from smoothing production requirements on final assembly line
- Kanban systems can handle +/- 10% demand changes
- Reduce variability with more accurate forecasts
- Smooth demand across planning horizon
- Mixed-model assembly steadies component production

## Quality at the Source

- Visual control
  - makes problems visible
- Poka-yokes
  - prevent defects from occurring
- Kaizen
  - a system of continuous improvement; “change for the good of all”
- Jidoka
  - authority to stop the production line
- Andons
  - call lights that signal quality problems
- Under-capacity scheduling
  - leaves time for planning, problem solving, and maintenance

## Examples of Visual Control

Tool Boards

Visual Kanban’s

Machine Controls

## 5 Whys

- A key part in an effective **Kaizen** is finding the root cause of a problem and eliminating it
- A practice of asking “why?” repeatedly until the underlying cause is identified (usually requiring five questions)
- Simple, yet powerful technique for finding the root cause of a problem
