# MGB235 Lecture 7 – 16/4/2024

## 1\. Process Planning

- **Process**
  - Group of related tasks with specific inputs & outputs
- **Process strategy**
  - an organization’s overall approach for physically producing goods and services
- **Process design**
  - tasks to be done & how they are coordinated among functions, people, & organizations
- **Process planning**
  - converts designs into workable instructions for manufacture or delivery

How they should plan or design the most efficient processes within the business.

The conversion of that process design into tools.

### Process Strategy

- Vertical integration
  - extent to which firm will produce inputs and control outputs of each stage of production process
- Capital intensity
  - mix of capital (i.e., equipment, automation) and labor resources used in production process
- Process flexibility
  - ease with which resources can be adjusted in response to changes in demand, technology, products or services, and resource availability
- Customer involvement
  - role of customer in production process
  - What extend is the customer involved in the process

### Outsourcing

- Cost
  - Is it cheaper to make or buy the item?
- Capacity
  - Does the company have the capacity?
- Quality
  - Easier to control quality in your own factory
- Speed
  - Shipping time can reduce savings
- Reliability
  - Quality and timing are reliability measures
- Expertise
  - Protect proprietary information

Financial implications are related to this, looking at the financial perspective it makes sense to outsource.

## Sourcing Continuum

**High**

Joint Venture

(equity partner)

**Low**

**Strategic Alliance**

(long-term supplier

contract; collaborative

relationship)

Company/Supplier Involvement

**Single Contract**

(short-term contract or

single purchasing

decision)

### Process Selection

#### Process selection

- - **Refers to deciding on the way production of goods or services will be organized**
    - **It has major implications for**
      - **Capacity planning**
      - **Layout of facilities**
      - **Equipment**
      - **Design of work systems**

#### Two key questions in process selection

1. **How much variety will the process need to be able to handle?**
2. **How much volume will the process need to be able to handle?**

- **Projects (or Job shop)**
  - **one-of-a-kind production of a product to customer order**
- **Batch production.**
  - **process many different jobs at the same time in groups or batches**
- **Mass production (repetitive/Assembly)**
  - **produce large volumes of a standard product for a mass market**
- **Continuous production**
  - **used for very-high volume commodity products**

### Process Types

**A Job Shop, A Batch Process, A repetitive Process and A Continuous Process**

**Product-Process Matrix**

**Types of Process:**

### Sustainable Production of Goods and Services

- **There is increasing pressure for organizations to operate sustainable production processes**
- **According to the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production:**
  - **“Sustainable Production is the creation of goods and services using processes and systems that are: non-polluting; conserving of energy and natural resources; economically efficient; safe and healthful for workers, communities, and consumers; and, socially and creatively rewarding for all working people.”** [**https://www.uml.edu/research/lowell-center/**](https://www.uml.edu/research/lowell-center/)

## Process Selection with Break-Even Analysis (the outsourcing decision)

- **Study cost trade-offs based on demand volume**
- **Costs**
  - **Fixed costs**
    - **constant regardless of the number of units produced**
  - **Variable costs**
    - **vary with the volume of units produced**
- **Revenue**
  - **price at which an item is sold**

## Process Selection with Break-Even Analysis

- **Total Revenue**
  - **price times volume sold**
- **Profit**
  - **difference between total revenue and total cost**

**Break even point is when the total revenue line and the total cost line meet.**

**Multiple Processes – Indifference Point  
**

**With the process option selected: Plan the Process**

- **Set of documents that detail manufacturing, service & delivery specifications (based on the product design)**
  - **assembly charts**
  - **operations sheets**
  - **quality-control check-sheets**

**Operations Sheet for Plastic Part**

**2\. Process Analysis**

- **Systematic study of all aspects of a process**
  - **make it faster**
  - **more efficient**
  - **less costly**
  - **more responsive**
- **Basic tools**
  - **process flowcharts**
  - **diagrams**
  - **maps**

**Process Flowcharts**

- **Look at manufacture of product or delivery of service from broad perspective**
- **Incorporate**
  - **nonproductive activities (inspection, transportation, delay, storage)**
  - **productive activities (operations)**

**Building a Flowchart**

- **Determine objectives**
- **Define process boundaries**
- **Define units of flow**
- **Choose type of chart**
- **Observe process and collect data**
- **Map out process**
- **Validate chart**

**Process Flowchart of Apple Processing**

**Process Map\* or Swimlane Chart for a Restaurant Service  
**

**Total redesign of a process for breakthrough improvements  
**

**From Function to Process**

**Principles for Redesigning Processes**

- **Remove waste, simplify, and consolidate similar activities**
- **Link processes to create value**
- **Let the swiftest and most capable enterprise execute the process**
- **Flex process for any time, any place, any way**
- **Capture information digitally at the source and propagate it through process**
- **Provide visibility through fresher and richer information about process status**

**5\. How eService Technology is enhancing the Business & Customer Relationship**

**eService Technology; Service technologies used behind the scenes to facilitate your experience as a customer:**

**e.g.** [**WebJet**](http://www.webjet.com.au/about/webjet-customer-service-technology/)

**e.g. Technology has been used extensively in financial services to facilitate the large number of transactions and processing activities that must occur each day. BPay**

**e.g. Many health care facilities are adopting electronic medical record (EMR) systems that can be easily integrated with medical records, billing, patient scheduling, and accounting (e.g. Taiwan\* v** [**USA**](http://www.myseveralworlds.com/2008/04/19/npr-on-taiwans-health-care-system/)**); _“Taiwan spends 6.23 percent of its GDP each year on health care.  In comparison, the United States spends 16 percent” \*_**

**e.g. eService Technology at UPS such as handheld devices, UPSnet, UPS Mail, etc.**

**6\. Technology Challenges**

- Many Benefits

e.g. Logistical costs for information intensive services (music) are much cheaper for online businesses.

- **Many Challenges**

e.g. **Customer concerns;** online security, privacy issues.

e.g. **Supplier concerns**; music piracy

e.g. Logistical costs for manufactured goods are expensive for online businesses; Product returns to a virtual store?

- People – Process & Change **e.g.** [iPhone](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/a-million-robots--to-staff-unhappy-iphone-factories-20110802-1i8yg.html)
